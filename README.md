# minesweeperAI
An AI that can beat Minesweeper using a knowledge base.

With each turn, the AI will build upon a knowledge base of 'sentences'. Each sentence has information on a space's count of surrounding mines, making it possible for the AI to make inferences on which spaces are mines and which are safe, given enough knowledge. 

**How to run the program**

`exec(open("runner.py).read())`
